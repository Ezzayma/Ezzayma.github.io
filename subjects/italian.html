		<p>The subject of "Italian" focuses on the study of the Italian language, its literature, and the rich cultural heritage of Italy. This includes learning the grammar, vocabulary, and structure of the language, as well as developing skills in speaking, reading, writing, and comprehension. Beyond language acquisition, studying Italian often involves exploring Italy's contributions to art, history, philosophy, and cinema, along with examining literary works from renowned authors like Dante, Petrarch, and Italo Calvino. It provides a gateway to understanding the cultural and historical significance of Italy within a broader European and global context.</p>
