		<p>Computer Science is the study of computers, algorithms, and computational systems. It encompasses both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of computing. Key areas include software development, data structures, algorithms, artificial intelligence, databases, computer networks, and cybersecurity. Computer scientists design and analyze systems to solve complex problems, optimize performance, and innovate technology, impacting industries like healthcare, finance, entertainment, and communication. At its core, computer science is about understanding how information is processed, stored, and communicated in a digital form.</p>
